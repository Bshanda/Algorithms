// Algorithm analysis :-
{
  //  There are multiple ways to solve one problem
  //  Ex:- There are multiple ways to sort a list of numbers.
  //  How do we analyse which of them is most efficient algorithm ?
  //  Generally when we talk about performence, we use an absolute measure.
  // In general we say that person running 100 meters in 12 sec is faster then a person running it in 15 sec.
  // But for algorithm there are many factors effecting the efficiency. Like :-
  // Programming language used.
  // The computer used.
  // Other programs running at the same time.
  // Quality of Operating System.
}

// Definition of time and space complexity
{
  // We measuer the performence of an algorithm in TERMS OF IT'S INPUT SIZE.
  // Time complexity :- Amount of time used by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
  // Space complexity :- Amount of memory used by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
  // By evaluting against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but also more appropriate.
  // There is no one solution for every problem.It is good to know multiple solutions for a problem and use
  // the one which is best suited for the situation.
  // If your app has lots of memory you donot need to worry about the space complexity.
  // If your app has limited memory you can opt for solution which is relatively slower but needs less memory.
}

// How to represent complexity.
{
  // Asymptotic notations
  // -Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity.
  // 1. Big-O Notation(O-Notation) -- Worst case complexity
  // 2. Omega Notation(O-Notation) -- average case complexity
  // 1. Theta Notation(O-Notation) -- best case complexity
